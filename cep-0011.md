## Abstract

This document deals with how coala can automatically remove dead code using vulture through VultureBear.

## Implementing vulture API
Currently, vulture is only available as a command line tool, first step would be make it modular and extend it's
functionality as an API. We can harness this utility in the VultureBear.

## Refactoring VultureBear
Now, when we have a fully functional API, we need to refactor VultureBear so that it respects the new API.
